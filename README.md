# AoS Server Status

This project contains a script which allows you to obtain the status of any server running a ace of spades game server. This uses the buiild and shoot API in order to obtain the status, but can
be used with your own status APIs if necessary.

A demo can be viewed here: https://aos-status.mrparker.dev, and the script can be located here (download locally and use a CDN or your server to serve): https://github.com/mrparkerlol/aos-server-status/blob/main/server_status.js

Or, you can use this URL instead:
`https://aos-status.mrparker.dev/server_status.js`

The old PHP code can be found here: https://github.com/mrparkerlol/aos-server-status/tree/old
